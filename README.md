This project is not a big deal because I started from a template, however the goal was to develop a complete Occupational Health and Safety platform, in which critical controls and other safety factors could be mapped.

This project had a lot of expectations, however it did not prosper due to IT.

If anyone from IT reads this, haha salu2 x2
